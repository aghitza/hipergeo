  "body": "Suppose your career depends on solving sums like\r\n\r\n![Equation 1](http://s9.postimg.org/i1jtfiy57/eq1.png)\r\n\r\nor more intimidating ones as\r\n\r\n![Equation 2](http://s27.postimg.org/pwodij5bj/eq2.png)\r\n\r\nand your magic tricks toolbox fail to handle it.\r\nWhat is the last resort?\r\n\r\n## Synopsis\r\n\r\nI developed a Maxima package to either solve hypergeometric sums or prove they cannot be solved.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n__hipergeo__ is a hypergeometric package for the computer algebra system Maxima featuring:\r\n\r\n- Sister Celine implementation;\r\n- friendly link to Gosper implementation from `zeilberger' package;\r\n- Builds full recurrence from Zeilberger's algorithm;\r\n- Wilf-Zeilberger proof machinery along with WZ certificate implementation.\r\n\r\nFor Portuguese readers, you can refer to [base text](./cassio-pagnoncelli.pdf) for usage, algorithms,\r\ntheory, etc.\r\nHere you will have a pragmatic introduction to hypergeometric summation, 100% Maxima-oriented.\r\n\r\nAs for English readers, you can refer to the seminal\r\n[A=B book](http://www.amazon.com/A-B-Marko-Petkovsek/dp/1568810636)\r\nby Petkovsek, Wilf and Zeilberger for more details on the algorithms and a deeper insight into the theory.\r\n(This book uses Maple and Mathematica computer algebra systems rather than open source Maxima.)\r\n\r\n## Using the library\r\n\r\nIn Maxima, type\r\n\r\n```c\r\n> load('hipergeo.mac');\r\n```\r\n\r\nin order to load the package and browse the examples in the same directory.\r\n\r\nFirst example can merely be solved by first finding the anti-difference of the summand,\r\n\r\n```c\r\n> summand(k) := k*k!;\r\n> antidiff : gosper(summand, k);\r\nk!\r\n```\r\nand, by applying the fundamental theorem of calculus, that sum becomes n! - 1.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated, should you find any error please contact or send a push\r\nrequest and I will be delighted to cite your amendment.\r\n",
